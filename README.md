# Module 16 TicTacToe Introduction

In Module 16: Tic-Tac-Toe Exercise With React, We managed state across parent and child components. We also worked through the component lifecycle, by mounting (creating) components on the DOM, updating them, and unmounting(deleting) them from the DOM so they're no longer displayed.

# Roadmap for future improvements

I added a reset feature and removed the ability for the x and o to be clicked again. A roadmap for future improvements for this game code would be a timer and scorekeeper. This build is on html and vanilla javascript.
