# Road Map -TicTacToe

In Module 16: Tic-Tac-Toe Exercise With React, We managed state across parent and child components. We also worked through the component lifecycle, by mounting (creating) components on the DOM, updating them, and unmounting(deleting) them from the DOM so they're no longer displayed.

I added a reset feature and removed the ability for the x and o to be clicked again. Future improvements for this game code be a timer and score keeper.
